            <h2>Work Summary</h2>
            <p>Research has shown that individuals can experience heightened emotions without even reading entire news stories.<sup>1</sup> This study aimed to analyze headlines to identify patterns among news sources and assess the degree of misleading content. The analysis revealed potential trends in the way popular news outlets craft headlines, often using sensational or biased language to attract attention. This research sought to mitigate the potential impact of such headlines on public perception and emotional responses, emphasizing the need for critical engagement with news media to foster better information processing and understanding.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The study used a dataset of ~ 4,000 news articles from a Harvard University dataset for NLP-tasks. The data was cleaned and loaded into an SQLite database, which was normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy and ensure efficient retrieval and update operations. The headlines were then retrieved and embedded using jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3. This model had ~ 572 million parameters and embedding size of 1024. Following some initial clustering analysis, I ended up using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 instead which contains 23M parameters and an output dimension of 384. The embeddings were then visualized using t-SNE to identify patterns in the data. Pairwise Euclidean distances were calculated to assess the similarity of headlines by source. The text was then summarized with a large-context window model, specifically the Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q4_K_M model. This model was quantized to 4 bits to reduce the model size and inference time. The summaries were generated with max 150 tokens and a minimum length of 50 tokens. The summaries were then compared to the original text to assess the quality of the summaries.</p>

            <h2>Visual Insights</h2>
            <p>Here we examine the distribution of news sources in the dataset (Figure 1) and visualize trends in headline embeddings (Figure 2). We further investigated the average pairwise Euclidean distance between headlines by source (Figure 3). The same methodology was applied to article summaries to explore the distribution and average distances (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Finally, we examined the overall distribution of distances between headline and summary embeddings across sources (Figure 6) and performed a statistical comparison of distributions using a Student's t-test (Figure 7). Our data shows that Tass and China Daily appear to have the lowest spread when it comes to the content and style of their headlines and news articles. Spot-checking the interactive visualization, it appears to be related to mentioning the respective home country of the news publication, often in the context of foreign relations. However, this is an analysis of content from a specific time period and may not be representative of the news sources today. We can also see that most sources have a similar relationship between content and headlines. However, the sources with the largest difference were dw, cnn, and china daily.</p>
